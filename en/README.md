# I - Book intent

AnyBlok is a Python framework to build business applications.

This tutorial is made to teach you how to develop applications with
AnyBlok.

## Reader requirements

We expect the reader to know at least one procedural programming language!

Ready!?

## Summary

If you are in a hurry and wants to quickly give it a try, or just set up a new
project without verbose concepts you may read this [how to set up project with
cookiecutter](02_project/02_cookiecutter.md)

We try to make each section of this book independent, so you can read it the 
way you want and later refer to it while developing your project.

All examples and exercices are available and extracted from a dedicated repo:
[AnyBlok book examples][anyblok_book_examples] that makes easy to test them or
start this tutorial from any section.

Let's imagine a business story that gives a guideline to this book. You have
to develop an online service to schedule classrooms booking so teachers can
know where they will give their courses.

* [I - Discover AnyBlok](01_discovery/README.md): Understanding AnyBlok
  concepts. For what it is a useful framework and available features. We will
  end with our vision and projects to create an eco-system around AnyBlok.

* [II - Setup your project](02_project/README.md): Learn how to set up your
  development environment, initialize a new project, run it \o/ and understand
  how it is composed.

* [III - First Bloks](blok/README.md): Start to develop!
  Discover AnyBlok features that makes it really modular, and let you get full
  control to create products that others can reuse and adapt to their own
  business.

* [IV - Create a service](04_service/README.md): It's time to expose your
  service through http, provide a REST API and use it in a graphical user
  interface, play with pyramid facilities and use existing utility Bloks.
